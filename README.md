# PRODIGY_DS_03

### Description:
This GitHub repository contains code for building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The code utilizes a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Bank Marketing dataset. The repository includes Python code, a Google colab, and the dataset used in the analysis.

### Key Features:

### Data Preprocessing: 
The code preprocesses the dataset, handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical features.
### Model Building: 
It uses the scikit-learn library to create a Decision Tree Classifier.
### Hyperparameter Tuning: 
GridSearchCV is employed to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
### Cross-Validation: 
The model's performance is assessed through cross-validation.
### Model Evaluation: 
The accuracy and a classification report are provided to evaluate the model's performance.
### Decision Tree Visualization: 
The code includes a visualization of the decision tree with improved settings.
